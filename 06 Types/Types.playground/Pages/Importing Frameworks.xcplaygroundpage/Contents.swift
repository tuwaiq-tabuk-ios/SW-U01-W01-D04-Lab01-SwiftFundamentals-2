 ## Importing Frameworks
 
 To use a framework in your program, you have to `import` it. That's done like this:
*/

import Foundation
//: One of the types from the Foundation framework is `Date`, which represents a specific moment in time. To create a `Date` representing _right now_, you simply use `Date()`:
let today = Date()

let mystring = "this is a litterl"
let somedate = Date () + 525600
let somedate1 = Date () + 120
let somedate2 = Date ()
