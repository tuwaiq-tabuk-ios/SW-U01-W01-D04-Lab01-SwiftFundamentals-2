 ## Exercise: If Statement Practice
 
 Come to grips with the if statement by rewriting the following comments in code form.

let a = 20
let b = 30
let c = 20


//: - callout(Exercise): Add code after each comment above to follow the instructions. (For the greater than and less than operators, remember the rule about the hungry mouth.)

// If a is equal to c, print "a and c are the same"
if a == c {
    "a and c are the same"
}



// If a is less than b, print "b is ahead of a"

else if a < b {
    " b is ahead of a "
}

// If b is greater than a, print "a is not winning against b"

else if b > a {
    " a is not winning against b "
}

// If a is less than or equal to c, print "a is either losing to or tied with c"

else if a <= c {
    " a is either losing to or tied with c"
}
